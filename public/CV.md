<p style="text-align: center;"> Hello ðŸ‘‹. Thank you for taking the time to read this today ðŸ˜Š</p>

I'm an iOS developer, with 8 years of experience. This includes: writing apps from scratch, creating SDKs and developer tools, hiring other developers, leading remote teams and being the sole developer on a project. I also organise and speak at community events; Iâ€™m most known for starting up [NSLondon](https://nslondon.com), curating speakers for early years of [AltConf](http://altconf.com) and I've given talks at [360iDev](https://www.360idev.com), [NSSpain](https://nsspain.com) and [trySwift! (Tokyo)](https://tryswift.co) among others.
